        <h2>UX/UI lead & e-commerce redesign for Kipli </h2>
           <p>July 2019 → May 2021</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX/UI Lead<br>
     <strong>Product type:</strong> e-commerce (woocommerce)<br>
     <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Engineering team
  </p>
     
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Starting with a natural latex mattress, the brand expended to a whole range of non-plastic and local made products for the house. This fast-growing young startup needed to <b>strengthen its brand presence and drive sales through its main growth channel: its e-commerce site</b>. I was in charge of the e-commerce site relaunch.</p>


<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>
Kipli was evolving from a single-product brand to a full home collection rooted in sustainability. 
However, the existing website was not equipped to support this growth. It suffered from several key issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An outdated visual <b>identity not aligned</b> with the brand’s ecological positioning</li>
  <li>An information <b>architecture designed for one product</b>, not an entire range</li>
  <li><b>Major gaps in product education</b> for a complex natural-material product</li>
  <li><b>Frequent customer service requests</b> due to unclear content and transactional communication</li>
  <li><b>Lack of consistency in UI patterns</b> and no unified design system</li>
  <li><b>Limited SEO-friendly content</b> structure and no scalable landing page framework</li>
  <li>Ineffective transactional emails and <b>weak retention</b> flows</li>
</ul>
<p>
The challenge was to <b>rethink the full user experience—navigation</b>, <b>product education</b>, <b>brand expression</b>, and <b>email communication</b> while supporting the <b>brand’s scaling</b>, improving <b>conversions</b>, and reinforcing Kipli’s strong sustainability <b>narrative</b>.
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<h4>Research &amp; Discovery</h4>
<p>
I began with a <b>complete UX/UI audit</b> to identify usability issues, conversion bottlenecks, and visual inconsistencies.
To ground decisions in real behavior and needs, I conducted research with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>External users (customers):</strong> interviews, behavioral analysis, journey mapping</li>
  <li><strong>Internal teams:</strong> Customer Service and Operations, in order to identify recurring pain points</li>
</ul>
<p>
I synthesized <b>insights</b> into updated <b>personas</b> and complete user journey maps, highlighting friction points,gaps in product understanding, and opportunities to strengthen brand trust.

</div>

<h4>Strategy &amp; Specification (Waterfall Approach)</h4>


<p>
  <ul>
<li><b>Brand positionning</b>: strengthen Kipli’s identity as transparent, sustainable, and grounded in natural materials. 
This required a <b>new art direction</b>, a <b>refined logo</b>, an updated brand signature, and a <b>simplified, authentic visual language</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>SEO &amp; Content Architecture</b>: I defined a scalable content structure to support organic growth and future campaigns. 
This included <b>SEO landing pages</b> for paid acquisition and a SEO-driven product page content and hierarchy.
</p></li>

<lI><p>
<b>Conversion optimization</b>: I <b>improved the purchase funnel</b> by reducing friction, simplifying content architecture,
and enhancing product education and upsell.
</p></lI>
</ul>

<h4>UX/UI Design Execution</h4>

<p>
<b>Information architecture</b>: I restructured the entire site to reflect a <b>multi-category product catalog</b>.
The new architecture supports intuitive browsing, clear hierarchy, and future product expansion.
</p>


<p><b>Design system:</b>
I led the creation of a cohesive design system built around:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Natural color palettes</b> inspired by Kipli’s materials</li>
  <li><b>Simplified UI patterns</b></li>
  <li><b>Updated typography</b> and interaction rules</li>
  <li><b>A refined logo and brand signature</b>: “bring nature home”</li>
</ul>

<div class="project">

       <img src="system.jpg" alt="system">
        <figcaption class="note">New palettes for Kipli</figcaption>
     </figure>
</div>

<p>
This system brought <b>consistency</b> across the website, emails, and future brand extensions.
</p>

<p><b>Art direction:</b> to align visuals with the brand’s values, we chose to orientate the art direction towards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Natural lighting</b></li>
  <li><b>Real people and real home environments</b></li>
  <li><b>Visible nature in the rooms</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
I briefed and supervised the <b>photoshoot</b> to ensure coherence with UX needs and brand authenticity.
</p>

<h4>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h4>
<p>
I created all <b>wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes</b> in Adobe XD, iterating through multiple testing cycles.
Key components included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Full responsive mockups</b> (mobile, tablet, desktop)</li>
  <li>A <b>modular pop-up system</b> for marketing operations and partnerships</li>
  <li><b>New educational modules</b> explaining sustainable materials in a simple and engaging way</li>
</ul>
<br>

        <figcaption class="note">Example of responsive view for the "mattress" product category</figcaption>
     </figure>
</div>
<br>
<h4>Development Supervision</h4>
<p>
I <b>collaborated closely with developers</b> throughout the build phase to validate design system implementation, responsive behavior, component accuracy, and checkout flow consistency.
</p>

<h4>Email Experience Optimization</h4>

<h4>Transactional Emails</h4>
<p>
I <b>redesigned all transactional emails</b> to improve clarity, reduce customer uncertainty,
and ensure consistent branding—resulting in a <strong>10% decrease in cart abandonment</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Automated Retention &amp; Post-Purchase Flows</h4>
<p>
I rewrote onboarding, loyalty, and reactivation email sequences.</p>
<p>These improvements generated a <strong>14% increase in post-purchase sales</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
The redesigned e-commerce experience significantly strengthened Kipli’s digital presence,
conversion performance, and brand coherence.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>An authentic visual identity</b> aligned with sustainability</li>
  <li><b>A scalable site structure</b> supporting a growing multi-category catalog</li>
  <li><b>10% decrease in cart abandonment</b> thanks to improved transactional communication</li>
  <li><b>14% increase in post-purchase sales</b> through refined automated flows</li>
  <li><b>A unified and scalable design system</b> adopted across digital touchpoints</li>
  <li><b>Reduced support inquiries</b> through improved content clarity and product education</li>
</ul>

   <br>
<p>
<b>The project transformed Kipli’s e-commerce platform into a scalable, user-centered,
and brand-coherent ecosystem that supports long-term growth while reinforcing its mission of sustainability.</b>
</p>
 <p>Kipli became in just three years the e-commerce <b>leader in France for home sustainable furnitures.</b></p>
 <p>Alfter three years of activity, the brand was valued <b>200M€</b>.</p>

<h3>What I learned</h3>

<p>Through the Kipli e‑commerce redesign, I deepened my expertise in leading a full UX/UI redesign for a fast‑growing digital brand, integrating strategic research, information architecture, and design system creation to support scalable growth. I learned how to align product and brand values with user needs, rethink complex multi‑category site structures, and collaborate closely with engineering to ensure quality execution. The project strengthened my ability to connect visual art direction with functional UX, optimize conversion‑driven interfaces, and measure impact through improved key metrics such as abandonment rates and retention flows.</p>

<p class="footnote">
    <em>Note:</em> several interventions on Kipli's e-commerce have occured since this project has been led - the current online version does not entirely reflect the work previously done.
