        <h1>e-commerce redesign (UX/UI lead) for Kipli</h1>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Starting with a natural latex mattress, the brand expended to a whole range of non-plastic and local made products for the house. This fast-growing young startup needed to <b>strengthen its brand presence and drive sales through its main growth channel: its e-commerce site</b>. I was in charge of the e-commerce site relaunch.</p>


<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>
Kipli was evolving from a single-product brand to a full home collection rooted in sustainability. 
However, the existing website was not equipped to support this growth. It suffered from several key issues:
</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>An outdated visual identity not aligned with the brand’s ecological positioning</li>
  <li>An information architecture designed for one product, not an entire range</li>
  <li>Major gaps in product education for a complex natural-material product</li>
  <li>Frequent customer service requests due to unclear content and transactional communication</li>
  <li>Lack of consistency in UI patterns and no unified design system</li>
  <li>Limited SEO-friendly content structure and no scalable landing page framework</li>
  <li>Weak transactional emails performance and retention flows</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The challenge was to rethink the full user experience: navigation, product education, brand expression, and email communication ; while supporting the brand’s scaling, improving conversions, and reinforcing Kipli’s strong sustainability narrative.</b>
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h4>Research &amp; Discovery</h4>
<p>
I began with a <b>complete UX/UI audit</b> to identify usability issues, conversion bottlenecks, and visual inconsistencies.
To ground decisions in real behavior and needs, I conducted research with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>External users (customers):</strong> interviews, behavioral analysis, journey mapping</li>
  <li><strong>Internal teams:</strong> Customer Service and Operations, in order to identify recurring pain points</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>I synthesized insightsinto updated personas</b> and complete user journey maps, highlighting friction points,gaps in product understanding, and opportunities to strengthen brand trust.

<h4>Strategy &amp; Specification (Waterfall approach)</h4>


<p>
  <ul>
<li><b>Brand positionning</b>: strengthen Kipli’s identity as transparent, sustainable, and grounded in natural materials. 
This required a <b>new art direction</b>, a <b>refined logo</b>, an updated brand signature, and a <b>simplified, authentic visual language</b>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>SEO &amp; Content architecture</b>: I defined a scalable content structure to support organic growth and future campaigns. 
This included <b>SEO landing pages</b> for paid acquisition and a SEO-driven product page content and hierarchy.
</p></li>

<lI><p>
<b>Conversion optimization</b>: I <b>improved the purchase funnel</b> by reducing friction, simplifying content architecture,
and enhancing product education and upsell.
</p></lI>
</ul>

<h4>UX/UI Design Execution</h4>

<p>
<b>Information architecture</b>: I restructured the entire site to reflect a <b>multi-category product catalog</b>.
The new architecture supports intuitive browsing, clear hierarchy, and future product expansion.
</p>


<p><b>Design system:</b>
I led the creation of a cohesive design system built around:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Natural color palettes</b> inspired by Kipli’s materials</li>
  <li><b>Simplified UI patterns</b></li>
  <li><b>Updated typography</b> and interaction rules</li>
  <li><b>A refined logo and brand signature</b>: “bring nature home”</li>
</ul>

<div class="illustration">

       <img src="system.jpg" alt="system">
     </figure>
</div>

<p>
This system brought <b>consistency</b> across the website, emails, and future brand extensions.
</p>

<p><b>Art direction:</b> to align visuals with the brand’s values, we chose to orientate the art direction towards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Natural lighting</b></li>
  <li><b>Real people and real home environments</b></li>
  <li><b>Visible nature in the rooms</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
I briefed and supervised the <b>photoshoot</b> to ensure coherence with UX needs and brand authenticity.
</p>

<h4>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h4>
<p>
I created all <b>wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes</b> in Adobe XD, iterating through multiple testing cycles.
Key components included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Full responsive mockups</b> (mobile, tablet, desktop)</li>
  <li><b>A modular pop-up system</b> for marketing operations and partnerships</li>
  <li><b>New educational modules</b> explaining sustainable materials in a simple and engaging way</li>
</ul>
<!--<div class="project">

</div>-->
<h4>Development supervision</h4>
<p>
<b>I collaborated closely with developers</b> throughout the build phase to validate design system implementation, responsive behavior, component accuracy, and checkout flow consistency.
</p>
<p>My work consisted in monitoring the implementation of the different pages to ensure compliance with designs and UX/UI standards, with a particular focus on responsive behavior.</p>

<h4>Email experience optimization</h4>

<p>
<b>I redesigned all transactional emails</b> to improve clarity, reduce customer uncertainty,
and ensure consistent branding—resulting in a <strong>10% decrease in cart abandonment</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Automated retention &amp; post-purchase flows</h4>
<p>
I rewrote onboarding, loyalty, and reactivation email sequences.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
The redesigned e-commerce experience significantly strengthened Kipli’s digital presence,
conversion performance, and brand coherence.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>An authentic visual identity</b> aligned with sustainability</li>
  <li><b>A scalable site structure</b> supporting a growing multi-category catalog</li>
  <li><b>10% decrease in cart abandonment</b> thanks to improved transactional communication</li>
  <li><b>14% increase in post-purchase sales</b> through refined automated flows</li>
  <li><b>A unified and scalable design system</b> adopted across digital touchpoints</li>
  <li><b>Reduced support inquiries</b> through improved content clarity and product education</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>The project transformed Kipli’s e-commerce platform into a scalable, user-centered,
and brand-coherent ecosystem that supports long-term growth while reinforcing its mission of sustainability.</b>
</p>
 <p>Kipli became in just three years the e-commerce leader in France for home sustainable furnitures.</p>
 <p>Alfter three years of activity, the brand was valued 200M€.</p>

<h2>What I've learned</h2>

<p>Through the Kipli e‑commerce redesign, I deepened my expertise in leading a full UX/UI redesign for a fast‑growing digital brand, integrating strategic research, information architecture, and design system creation to support scalable growth. I learned how to align product and brand values with user needs, rethink complex multi‑category site structures, and collaborate closely with engineering to ensure quality execution.</p> <p>The project strengthened my ability to connect visual art direction with functional UX, optimize conversion‑driven interfaces, and measure impact through improved key metrics such as abandonment rates and retention flows.</p>
<br>

    <em>Note:</em> several interventions on Kipli's e-commerce have occured since this project has been led - the current online version does not entirely reflect the work previously done.
