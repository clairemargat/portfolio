          <h3>Product Designer at We Share Trust</h3>
          <h4>I designed the MVP of a Software as a Service <i>from the ground up</i></h4>
          <p>I conceived a <b>moderation reviews software</b> capable to effectively answer business and users needs.</p>
          <p><i>We Share Trust</i> is a start-up that makes e-commerce leaders products available to a panel of voluntary <b>consumers who have chosen to comply with the requirements of an independent test.</b></p>
          <p>Each WeShareTrust test is conducted at the tester’s home and remotely supervised by a test expert. Testers receive the product at home and must use it for a minimum period before writing their review. </p>
          <p>All reviews are checked to ensure the accuracy and sincerity of the opinions expressed. The WeShareTrust teams go beyond simply confirming that the product has been received by the tester. They also verify that it has been properly used, notably through a phone interview and a detailed analysis of each review prior to <b>moderation</b>.</p>

My role took place in the context of exploring the complementarity between the two companies’ activities, both from a business and a technical perspective.</p>
