        <h1>e-commerce redesign for Dumas Paris</h1>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
Dumas Paris is the luxury brand of La Compagnie Dumas, specializing in high-end blankets and pillows crafted with exceptional materials and savoir-faire. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage, craftsmanship and contemporary luxury, the brand required an e-commerce experience capable of reflecting its premium identity while supporting direct-to-consumer growth.
        </p>
        <p>
The objective of the project was to redesign the e-commerce website to elevate the brand’s digital presence, reinforce its luxury positioning, and deliver a seamless, elegant and technically robust shopping experience aligned with the brand’s standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
Unlike mass-market bedding, Dumas Paris products rely on subtle distinctions, exceptional materials and craftsmanship details that must be carefully conveyed online. The challenge was to translate a luxury in-store experience into a digital journey that felt refined, reassuring and immersive.
        </p>
        <p>
At the same time, the platform needed to meet performance, scalability and operational requirements, while integrating smoothly with existing systems and marketing tools.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expressing luxury positioning and craftsmanship through digital experience</li>
          <li>Highlighting product excellence and materials without overwhelming the user</li>
          <li>Designing a refined, intuitive user journey aligned with luxury codes</li>
          <li>Ensuring visual consistency and strong artistic direction</li>
          <li>Balancing storytelling with conversion and usability</li>
          <li>Integrating marketing features while preserving a premium experience</li>
          <li>Ensuring technical reliability, performance and scalability</li>
          <li>Coordinating e-commerce architecture with ERP systems</li>
          <li>Structuring the site to support SEO while maintaining brand elegance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
I led the project from discovery to launch, acting as a central coordinator between brand stakeholders, artistic direction, external designers, developers and technical partners. The project also included close collaboration with factories. The process began with brand immersion, market analysis and competitive benchmarking within the luxury and home sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
User insights and buying behaviors were analyzed to understand expectations around reassurance, product storytelling and premium service. These insights informed the UX strategy, content hierarchy and user flows.
        </p>
        <p>
I defined the project scope and briefed the external web agency, while supervising UX/UI design and artistic direction to ensure alignment with luxury brand codes. I also coordinated and supervised product and lifestyle photoshoots, with a strong focus on materials, textures and detail.
        </p>
        <p>
The design process was iterative, from wireframes to refined UI, with continuous validation. I ensured consistency through a shared design system and worked closely with developers on integration, ERP coordination and deployment, followed by testing and QA.
        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
The redesigned platform strengthened Dumas Paris’ digital presence and provided a solid foundation for its luxury direct-to-consumer strategy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A refined and immersive e-commerce experience aligned with luxury standards</li>
          <li>Improved clarity and storytelling around products and craftsmanship</li>
          <li>A smooth and elegant user journey across desktop and mobile</li>
          <li>A technically stable and scalable platform</li>
          <li>Seamless integration with ERP and marketing tools</li>
          <li>Improved site structure supporting long-term SEO performance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I’ve learned</h2>
        <p>
This project deepened my understanding of translating luxury brand values into digital experiences, where every interaction, visual detail and technical choice contributes to perceived quality.
        </p>
        <p>
It also reinforced my role as a strategic and operational pivot, aligning brand vision, UX excellence and technical constraints while working with fully outsourced teams and high standards of execution.

          <em>Note:</em> The live version of the website differs from the one delivered during the redesign phase. While some elements have evolved over time, the core user experience, functionalities and artistic direction remain aligned with the foundations I defined and implemented.
