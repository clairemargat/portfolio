        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Petit Meunier is the consumer bedding brand (duvets and pillows) of La Compagnie Dumas, a French SME known for its industrial expertise. While the products themselves are highly technical and premium, they are often perceived by the general public as standard and difficult to differentiate.The objective of the project was to redesign the e-commerce website to support the brand’s growth ambitions by creating a clear, conversion-oriented and technically viable shopping experience.</p>


<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>
The main challenge was to design an e-commerce experience able to make technically complex bedding products understandable, attractive and easy to buy. Duvets and pillows involve multiple criteria — warmth, fill, firmness, usage — that are difficult for users to compare and often poorly understood by the general public.
</p>
<p>
Beyond product comprehension, the platform had to support strong growth ambitions while remaining technically robust and scalable. The redesign needed to balance UX quality, conversion performance, technical constraints and integration with existing systems.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structuring clear and explicit product ranges to simplify navigation and comparison</li>
  <li>Helping users confidently choose the right product through guided decision-making</li>
  <li>Enhancing perceived value while aligning with price positioning</li>
  <li>Creating visual appeal for products with low natural differentiation</li>
  <li>Designing a smooth, conversion-oriented user journey</li>
  <li>Integrating marketing mechanisms such as email capture, cross-selling and upselling</li>
  <li>Ensuring technical viability, performance and long-term scalability</li>
  <li>Coordinating the website with the existing ERP system</li>
  <li>Addressing SEO and site architecture constraints during the migration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
I led the project end-to-end, acting as the central point of coordination between business stakeholders, external designers, developers and technical partners. The process started with market research and competitive analysis, followed by a discovery phase to align business objectives, user needs and technical constraints.
</p>
<p>
User interviews were conducted to better understand buying behaviors and decision blockers. These insights informed the UX strategy and the definition of user flows, content structure and functional priorities.
</p>
<p>
I wrote the project brief for the external web agency and supervised UX/UI designers and artistic direction throughout the project. I also coordinated and supervised product and lifestyle photoshoots to support product clarity and desirability.
</p>
<p>
The design phase was iterative, moving from wireframes to detailed UI designs, with regular reviews and validations. I ensured consistency through a shared design system and worked closely with developers on integration, ERP connections and deployment, followed by testing and QA prior to launch.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
The redesigned e-commerce platform provided Petit Meunier with a solid foundation for its direct-to-consumer growth, improving both user experience and operational efficiency.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Significant growth in online sales and conversion performance</li>
  <li>Improved product understanding and user decision-making</li>
  <li>Clearer product architecture supporting scalability</li>
  <li>Smoother, more consistent experience across desktop and mobile</li>
  <li>Technically robust platform integrated with ERP and marketing tools</li>
  <li>Stronger SEO foundations and site structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I’ve learned</h2>
<p>
This project reinforced my ability to lead complex digital initiatives in environments with strong technical and organizational constraints. Working with a fully outsourced team required clear communication, structured processes and strong prioritization.
</p>
<p>
Acting as a pivot between business, design and technical stakeholders strengthened my ability to translate strategic objectives and technical limitations into user-centered solutions, while maintaining delivery quality, performance and long-term maintainability.

<p class="footnote">
    <em>Note:</em> The live version of the website differs from the one I worked on during the redesign phase. While some elements have evolved over time, the overall user experience, core functionalities, and artistic direction remain consistent with the foundations I defined and delivered.
