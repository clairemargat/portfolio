        <h3>Product Designer at We Share Trust</h3>
        <h4>I collaborated with the Product Manager to design the MVP of a Software as a Service <i>from the ground up</i></h4>
        <p><i>We Share Trust</i> is a French start-up that makes e-commerce leaders products available to a panel of voluntary <b>consumers who have chosen to comply with the requirements of an independent test.</b></p>
        <p>Testers receive the product at home and must use it for a minimum period before writing their review. Each product test is conducted at the tester’s home and remotely supervised by a test expert. </p>
        <p>All reviews are checked to ensure the accuracy and sincerity of the opinions expressed. The WeShareTrust teams also verify that the product has been properly used, notably through a phone interview and a detailed analysis of each review prior to <b>moderation</b>.</p>
        <p>The client contacted me to help conceiving a <b>moderation reviews software</b> capable to effectively answer business and users needs.</b></p>
