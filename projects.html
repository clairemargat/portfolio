          <h1>product design for We Share Trust</h1>
          <div class="infos">
            <p> July 2024 → December 2024<br>
     BtoB Saas<br>collab. Product Manager, Engeneering team</p>
   </div>

        
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p><i>We Share Trust</i> is a French start-up that makes e-commerce leaders products available to a panel of voluntary <b>consumers who have chosen to comply with the requirements of an independent test.</b></p><p>Testers deliver authentic reviews deeply checked by the WeShareTrust teams prior to <b>moderation</b>.</p>
        <p>The client contacted me to help conceiving a <b>moderation reviews software</b> capable to effectively answer business requirements and users needs.</p>

        <h2>
        Key challenges
      </h2>

      <p>
<ul>

<li><b>Integrating into a young, evolving company culture</b>: product function still being structured.</li>

<li><b>Defining the product scope from scratch</b>: establishing core workflows and priorities.</li>

<li><b>Complex moderation workflows</b>: handling varied scenarios efficiently.</li>

<li><b>Usability and accessibility</b>: designing an intuitive tool for diverse users.</li>

<li><b>Scalability and future growth</b>: building modular, reusable components.</li>

<li><b>Stakeholder alignment</b>: translating legal and operational requirements into design.</li>

<li><b>AFNOR compliance</b>: ensuring user data handling meets consumer rights standards.</li>
</ul>
      </p>


      <h2>Design activities on Figjam</h2>

      <p>Preliminary functional and technical study were carried out. 
        <div class="illustration">
        <figure>
        <p>We used <b>Figjam</b> to model the expected features of the software, as well as the architecture of the moderation block and its related modules.</p>
       <img src="figjam.jpg" alt="Figjam">
     </figure>
   </div>
     <br>
    <p>The user map modeling allowed us to:</p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Understanding the user journey</b>: gaining a clear and unified view of the user experience in order to identify pain points and needs.</li>

        <li><b>Improving the experience</b>: identifying opportunities for improvement or innovation to make the journey smoother and more satisfying.</li>

        <li><b>Aligning teams</b>: ensuring that all team members (developers, designers, marketing, etc.) share a common understanding of the customer experience.</li>

        <li><b>Guiding decisions</b>: helping prioritize the development of new features or interface improvements based on real user needs.</li></ul></p>

        <div class="illustration">
        <figure>
          <p><i>User map modeling: a visual and chronological representation of the user’s experience during their expected interaction with the product.</i></p>
          <img src="usermap.jpg" alt="Usermap">
       
        </figure>
      </div>
        <br>


      <p>
        The preliminary study helped to identify the main user groups, generate personas, and determine the key needs for each user profile.

<ul>
  <li><b>The Moderator</b>: responsible for moderating comments within the interface and maintaining a low volume of comments to review, while respecting legal deadlines.</li>

<li><b>The Key Account Manager</b>: responsible for the client account. They supervise the moderator’s work, have validation authority, and benefit from broader access within the interface.</li>

<li><b>The End Client (e-merchant)</b>: in order to monitor their brand reputation, they have the right to review and flag comments that do not comply with legal standards.</li>

<li><b>The Buyer</b> - who provides the data by leaving a comment on a purchased and used product. 
<br>This user does not have direct access to the interface, but actions taken within the interface may lead to consequences — such as blacklisting — in cases where a comment violates applicable standards.</li>
</ul>

The shared interface is <b>standardized</b>, while <b>specific features</b> and <b>access levels</b> are designed for each user type.
<b>Interactions both within and outside</b> the interface between the different user profiles are also prototyped.
      </p>

        <h2>Low to high fidelity mock-up design activities</h2>
        <div class="illustration">
          <p>From first intention, I iterated the design towards high-fidelity mock-up on Figma.</p>
          <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="lowfi.jpg" alt="lowfi">

          <b>See more wireframes →</b></a>
        </figure>
      </div>
        <p>It was then possible to produce an initial draft of the platform, then iterate toward more realistic versions that took both technical and user constraints into account.</p>
        <p>Thanks to efficient organization, we were able to <b>validate functional intentions, decline views and start building the first prototypes.</b></p>


      
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence feature integration</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence have made it possible to integrate, upstream of the manual moderation process, <b>an automatic moderation feature</b> based on the application of a rejection criterion - following the criterias defined by law.</p>
        <p><b>This significantly reduces the volume of incoming data</b> and decreases both the workload and the time-consuming nature of the tasks performed by users such as Moderators and Key Account Managers.
      </p>
          <h2>Design system creation</h2>

          <p>I developed a comprehensive <b>design system</b> aimed at improving <b>consistency</b>, <b>efficiency</b>, and <b>scalability</b> across all digital products. The main objectives were to <b>unify the visual identity</b>, <b>streamline the design and development process</b>, and <b>enhance collaboration</b> between designers and developers.</p>

          <p>To achieve these goals, I audited existing interfaces, identified recurring patterns, and <b>established a set of reusable UI components and design tokens</b> (colors, typography, spacing, etc.). I documented guidelines and best practices to ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and brand coherence.</p>
          <br>
          <div class="illustration">
          <figure>
          <img src="dsicones.jpg" alt="designsystem">
        </figure>
      </div>
          <br>
          <h2>Prototyping and User testing on Figma</h2>
          <p>Over 80 prototypes were built throughout the project.</p>
          
          <div class="illustration">
          <figure class="prototype">
             <p>To better guide technical teams, I designed <b>interactive prototypes on Figma</b> focusing on the platform’s key features.</p> 
  <video

    playsinline
    width="640"
    height="360"
  ></video>
  <br>
</figure>
</div>

<br>
          <p>Prototypes helped to:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Visualize user flows and system interactions.</b></li>

              <li><b>Create user scenarios for tests</b> allowed to better understand how they interacted with the system and to validate the usability and ergonomics of the interface.</li>

              <li><b>Collect consistent and constructive feedback.</b></li>
                <li><b>Refine design and implement necessary improvements</b>.</li></ul></p>
              <p>For example, certain buttons — particularly within the blacklisting process (for managing blacklisted users) — <b>were redesigned to better match the realistic workflows of the moderator user group.</b></p>

              <p>The final mockups were completed and adjusted and submitted for validation before moving forward with the next stages of development and the creation of additional views and features.</p>

              <h2>Technical documentation writing</h2>
              <div class="illustration">
              <figure>
                <img src="documentation.jpg" alt="documentation">
                
              </figure>
            </div>
            <br>
              <p>I delivered a <b>detailed technical documentation</b> covering all the views and components developed during the project.</p>
              <p>This documentation was created to ensure a <b>clear and consistent understanding</b> of the design system, user flows, and interaction logic among all team members. It served as a <b>reference guide for developers</b> during implementation and helped maintain alignment between the design intentions and the final product.</p>
              <p>Additionally, it facilitated <b>future updates and scalability</b> by providing a structured and easily accessible overview of the platform’s functional and visual specifications.</p>
              <p>To be easily shared and read, the documentation was written on <b>Confluence</b>.</p>

              <h2>Deployment</h2>
              <p>Once the design system and main views were validated, I was able to expand the scope of the project by developing <b>additional user views and new features</b>. 

              <div class="illustration">
              <p>I the focused on building the <b>back-office interface and management settings</b>, ensuring that administrators could easily manage and customize the platform.</p> 
              <br>
                <figure>
                  <img src="acces.jpg" alt="acces">
          
                </figure>
              </div>
              <br>
              <div class="illustration">
              <p>I also designed a <b>review collection module</b>, which allowed Buyer-type users to submit reviews.</p>
              <br>
              <figure>
              <img src="depot.jpg" alt="depot">

              </figure>
            </div>
            <br>
            
 
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
            <li><b>Over 500 frames</b>,</li>
            <lI><b>80 prototypes</b>,</lI>
            <li><b>detailed documentation</b></li></ul>
            <p>were delivered to the client, allowing the technical team to deploy.</p>
            <p>This MVP has therefore been sold to clients having previously demonstrated interest to invest.</b>
            </p>
            </p>

            <h2>What I've learned</h2>
